Most previous research, however, have worked on intractable problems, where a true chronology will never be known with certainty, such as the works of Plato, Shakespeare or Marlowe. It is argued here that stylochronometric methods should be extensively tested on unproblematic texts before being used in disputed cases. As part of such testing, the present study applies a novel technique, Monte-Carlo Feature-Finding, to the verse of W. B. Yeats, where the dating is relatively well documented. Yeats insisted that his language changed as he grew older, and most readers would concur; yet scholars have not reached agreement on the nature of this linguistic change. A quasi-random search algorithm was used to find markers substrings in 142 poems of Yeats. To test their distinctiveness, four trials were performed: (1) assignment of ten poems absent from the training sample to their correct period; (2) detecting differences in two poems written by Yeats in his twenties and revised when he was fifty; (3) constructing a regression formula; and (4) classifying two prose extracts written forty-six years apart. Assigning short poems (median length 114 words) to their correct chronological period is a non-trivial task. Nevertheless, counting of distinctive substrings gave the right assignment in nine out of ten unseen cases. Moreover, these substring frequencies were sensitive enough to detect authorial revision in two early poems revised by Yeats many years after he originally wrote them, and robust enough to classify a pair of short prose extracts correctly; as well as accounting for 71% of the variance when used in a regression to predict the year in which thirteen poems, absent from the training sample, were composed. These results suggest that short substrings found by a Monte-Carlo process warrant further investigation as stylistic indicators.","1999-12","2017-01-03 10:21:26","2017-01-03 10:21:26","2011-12-14 09:27:09","467 -478","","4","14","","","Stylochronometry with substrings, or","","","","","","","en","","","","","Highwire 2.0","","bibtex: forsyth_stylochronometry_1999-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we use techniques from stylometry and machine learning to address subjective literary critical questions about Latin literature, a corpus marked by an extraordinary concentration of intertextuality. Our work, which we term “quantitative criticism,” focuses on case studies involving two influential Roman authors, the playwright Seneca and the historian Livy. We find that four plays related to but distinct from Seneca’s main writings are differentiated from the rest of the corpus by subtle but important stylistic features. We offer literary interpretations of the significance of these anomalies, providing quantitative data in support of hypotheses about the use of unusual formal features and the interplay between sound and meaning. The second part of the paper describes a machine-learning approach to the identification and analysis of citational material that Livy loosely appropriated from earlier sources. We extend our approach to map the stylistic topography of Latin prose, identifying the writings of Caesar and his near-contemporary Livy as an inflection point in the development of Latin prose style. In total, our results reflect the integration of computational and humanistic methods to investigate a diverse range of literary questions.","2017-04-03","2017-04-09 10:53:21","2017-04-09 10:53:22","2017-04-09 10:53:21","201611910","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","00000  PMID: 28373557","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373557","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that such studies are involved in an act of reification, in which, moreover, fundamental ingredients of the texts, e.g. their (highly important) range of figurative meanings, are eliminated from the analysis. Instead a concentration on lower levels of linguistic organization, such as grammar and lexis, may be observed, in spite of the fact that these are often the least relevant aspects of the text. In doing so, quantitative studies of literature significantly reduce not only the cultural value of texts, but also the generalizability of its own findings. What is needed, therefore, is an awareness and readiness to relate to matters of textuality as an organizing principle underlying the cultural functioning of literary works of art.","1989-08-01","2017-01-03 10:16:48","2017-01-03 10:16:48","2014-05-23 10:15:59","301-307","","4-5","23","","Comput Hum","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","bibtex: peer_quantitative_1989","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition some authors influence other authors' interests. In this work, we propose to model the influence of cited authors along with the interests of citing authors. Moreover, we hypothesize that apart from the citations present in documents, the context surrounding the citation mention provides extra topical information about the cited authors. However, associating terms in the context to the cited authors remains an open problem. We propose novel document generation schemes that incorporate the context while simultaneously modeling the interests of citing authors and influence of the cited authors. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline models for various evaluation criteria such as link prediction between document and cited author, and quantitatively explaining unseen text.","2011","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-09 08:41:08","2014-11-11 12:03:44","2274–2280","","","","","","","IJCAI'11","","","","AAAI Press","Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","bibtex: kataria_context_2011","","","","AuthorshipAttribution; TopicModeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measures of Lexical Richness in Perspective","Computers and the Humanities","","0010-4817, 1572-8412","10.1023/A:1001749303137","http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1001749303137","A well-known problem in the domain of quantitative linguistics and stylistics concerns the evaluation of the lexical richness of texts. Since the most obvious measure of lexical richness, the vocabulary size (the number of different word types), depends heavily on the text length (measured in word tokens), a variety of alternative measures has been proposed which are claimed to be independent of the text length. This paper has a threefold aim. Firstly, we have investigated to what extent these alternative measures are truly textual constants. We have observed that in practice all measures vary substantially and systematically with the text length. We also show that in theory, only three of these measures are truly constant or nearly constant. Secondly, we have studied the extent to which these measures tap into different aspects of lexical structure. We have found that there are two main families of constants, one measuring lexical richness and one measuring lexical repetition. Thirdly, we have considered to what extent these measures can be used to investigate questions of textual similarity between and within authors. We propose to carry out such comparisons by means of the empirical trajectories of texts in the plane spanned by the dimensions of lexical richness and lexical repetition, and we provide a statistical technique for constructing confidence intervals around the empirical trajectories of texts. Our results suggest that the trajectories tap into a considerable amount of authorial structure without, however, guaranteeing that spatial separation implies a difference in authorship.","1998","2017-01-03 10:21:26","2017-01-03 10:21:26","2016-08-27 10:21:00","323-352","","5","32","","Computers and the Humanities","How Variable May a Constant be?","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","bibtex: tweedie_how_1998","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We achieve this task by a stylometric analysis of some stylistic markers tested in two Spanish corpora. The first corpus is composed of long texts written by professional authors, while the second corpus is formed by short texts written by students. In both corpora, different text genres are included. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze several stylometric variables to test its capacity as markers for authorship attribution when the corpora vary in size and text genre. We represent the texts as high dimensional vectors and we visualize the similarities between them using multidimensional scaling. We conclude that the length of texts is a factor that affects the discriminatory capacity of the stylometric variables. We also found that there are certain variables that are better than others to identify specific authors and specific text genres.","2013-10-25","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-05 13:45:24","2014-06-17 11:41:54","604-611","","","95","","","","Corpus Resources for Descriptive and Applied Studies.

It begins with the question: must valid statistical analysis of any literary text be based on a complete linguistic description of the language of the text? It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds. It emphasizes the importance of extended pre-computational stages of learning about language and discourse analysis; reading previous research, building on and challenging theory; and the use of carefully crafted, small databases to test specific questions.","1991","2016-08-17 21:59:03","2017-01-09 08:41:08","2016-08-17 21:59:03","401-429","","6","25","","Computers and the Humanities","Statistical Analysis of Literature","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","bibtex: potter_statistical_1991","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While previous methods have for instance been looking at characters (n-grams), syntax and most importantly token frequencies, the method presented focusses on the implications of semantic relationships between words. With this instead of authors word choices, semantic networks of entities as perceived by authors may come closer into focus. We find that those can be used reliably for authorship attribution. The method is generally applicable as a tool to compare different texts and/or authors through word embeddings which have been trained separately. This is achieved by not comparing vectors directly, but by comparing sets of most similar words for words shared between texts and then aggregating and averaging similarities per text pair. On two literary corpora (German, English), we compute embeddings for each text separately. The similarities are then used to detect the author of an unknown text.","2017-06-21","2017-06-28 07:02:18","2017-06-28 07:02:19","2017-06-28 07:02:18","274-277","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Cham","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because no method is perfect, using a set of methods on the same works can be used to give high probabilities of authorship. The JGAAP system houses a collection of methods such as Histogram Distance and Manhattan Distance and event sets such as word bigrams and character trigrams to allow users to perform multiple tests on contested works to see if the supposed author is actually the author by comparing samples from both the contested author and other possible authors. We apply this framework and show a notable discontinuity in the authorial style of the novel El Ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, better known as Don Quijote (or Don Quixote).","2010","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-21 11:56:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London","","","","","","","","bibtex: coufal_authorship_2010-1","","","","AuthorshipAttribution; lang_esp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Humanities Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Towards this aim, a three level description of FS is given that comprises: (a) the basic categories of FS; (b) the main features that characterize each one of the above categories; and (c) the linguistic identifiers that act as style markers in text for the identification of the above features. Special emphasis is put on the problems that faced the computational implementation of the aforementioned findings, as well as the selection of the most appropriate stylometrics (i.e., stylistic scores) to achieve better results on text categorization. This approach is language independent, empirically driven, and can be used in various applications including grammar and style checking, natural language generation, style verification in real world text, and recognition of style shift between adjacent portions of text.","1996","2017-01-03 10:19:39","2017-01-03 10:19:39","","71-77","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","bibtex: michos_empirical_1996","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",", Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 1996","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different from the existing author-topic model in which each author and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over topics and words, in AGTM, each genre, author, and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over authors, topics, and words, respectively. The bias of the distribution of the authors with respect to the topics can be rectified by incorporating the distribution of the genres with respect to the authors. Therefore, the classification accuracy of documents is improved when the information of genre is introduced. By representing the images with several visual words, the AGTM can be used for satellite image annotation. The labels of classes and scenes of the images correspond to the authors and the genres of the documents, respectively. The labels of classes and scenes of test images can be estimated, and the accuracy of satellite image annotation is improved when the information of scenes is introduced in the training images. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.","2014-02","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-09 08:41:08","","1356-1368","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","bibtex: luo_semantic_2014","","","","AuthorshipAttribution; genre; TopicModeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This involves the training of so-called neural networks to classify data even in the presence of noise and non-linear interactions within data sets. We provide an introduction to this technique, and show how to tailor it to the needs of stylometry. Specifically, we show how to construct so-called multi-layer perceptron neural networks to investigate questions surrounding purported works of Shakespeare and Fletcher. The Double Falsehood and The London Prodigal are found to have strongly Fletcherian characteristics, Henry VIII strongly Shakespearian characteristics, and The Two Noble Kinsmen characteristics suggestive of collaboration.","1993-01","2017-01-03 10:18:28","2017-01-03 10:18:28","2011-12-14 10:46:59","203 -209","","4","8","","","Neural Computation in Stylometry I","","","","","","","en","","","","","Highwire 2.0","","bibtex: matthews_neural_1993-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various uses of divesity are reviewed and an index of diversity derived from the distance measure of similarity is suggested. This index is ?i=1n2i where S equals the number of species and n equals the number of individuals in each species. This index is compared with other indices of diversity. The principal problem of measuring diversity is the assessment of the homogeneity or similarity of the sample or samples being studied. An advantage of the proposed index is that it derives from a measure of similarity of which it is a special case, and it is a special case, and it is a more natural and familiar representation of points in a coordinate system.

B.","Lexical diversity in the spontaneous speech of children with specific language impairment: application of D","Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research","","1092-4388 (Print) 1092-4388","","","The lexical diversity of children with specific language impairment (SLI) (ages 3 years 7 months to 7 years 3 months) was compared to that of normally developing same-age peers and younger normally developing children matched according to mean length of utterance in words (MLUw). Lexical diversity was calculated from spontaneous speech samples using D, a measure that uses repeated calculations of type-token ratio (TTR) to estimate how TTR changes as the speech samples increase in size. When D computations were based on 250-word samples, developmental differences were apparent. For both children with SLI and typically developing children, older subgroups showed higher D scores than younger subgroups, and subgroups with higher MLUws showed higher D scores than subgroups with lower MLUws. Children with SU did not differ from same-age peers. At lower MLUw levels, children with SLI showed higher D scores than younger typically developing children matched for MLUw. The developmental sensitivity of D notwithstanding, comparisons using 100-utterance samples, in which the number of lexical tokens varied as a function of the children's MLUws, and comparisons between 250- and 500-word samples revealed the possible influence of sample size on this measure. However, analysis of the effect sizes using smaller and larger samples revealed that D is not affected by sample size to the degree seen for more traditional measures of lexical diversity.","2002","2016-08-16 16:43:38","2016-08-16 16:43:38","","927-37","","5","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Owen, Amanda J Leonard, Laurence B 5 R01 DC00458/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States 5 T32 DC00030/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

In particular, we focus on  a.	the consistency of definitions given in different sources;  b.	the metrics used to calculate the level of keyness; c.	the compatibility between definitions and metrics. Our survey of studies employing keyword analysis has indicated that the vast majority of studies examine a subset of keywords – almost always the top X number of keywords as ranked by the metric used. This renders the issue of the appropriate metric central to any study using keyword analysis.  In this study, we first argue that an appropriate, and therefore useful, metric for keyness needs to be fully consistent with the definition of keyword. We then use four sets of comparisons between corpora of different types and sizes, in order to test whether and to what extent the use of different metrics affects the ranking of keywords. More precisely, we look at the extent of overlap in the keyword rankings resulting from the adoption of different metrics, and we discuss the implications of ranking-based analysis adopting one metric or another. Finally, we propose a new metric for keyness, and demonstrate a simple way to calculate the metric, which supplements the keyword extraction in existing corpus software.","2012","2017-01-03 10:39:27","2017-01-03 10:39:27","2014-11-22 11:06:46","","","","","","","Keyness","","","","","","University of Bologna, Italy","","","","","","repository.edgehill.ac.uk","","bibtex: gabrielatos_keyness:_2012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CADS International Conference 2012.

For this reason, semantic information addition is necessary for the definition of new NLP strategies. In this paper, a method oriented to pronominal anaphora resolution in Spanish is presented. This method is based on two ontologies, On and Ov, that define semantic concept branches for nouns and verbs respectively. Also, the method uses two relation sets in order to solve the anaphora. These sets are formed by semantic patterns that define the compatibility between a subject and its verb and verb and its complement, using the ontological concepts of their heads. The semantic behaviour provided by these patterns allows the identification of the noun phrase antecedents of a Spanish personal pronoun. This antecedent has the best compatibility ratio among all proposed antecedents of the anaphoric pronoun. This compatibility ratio is measured using the relation level between concepts in the ontological branch of each pair member.","2000","2016-09-12 15:58:19","2017-01-09 08:41:08","2016-09-12 15:58:19","204–211","","","","","","","NLP '00","","","","Springer-Verlag","London, UK, UK","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","bibtex: saiz-noeda_semantic_2000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a survey of the current state of the art as well as a framework for uniform and unified development of a tool to apply the state of the art, despite the wide variety of methods and techniques used. The usefulness of the framework is confirmed by the development of a tool using that framework that can be applied to authorship analysis by researchers without a computing specialization. Using this tool, it may be possible both to expand the pool of available researchers as well as to enhance the quality of the overall solutions [for example, by incorporating improved algorithms as discovered through empirical analysis (Juola, P.

The task was to detect and distinguish four types—direct, free indirect, indirect, and reported ST&WR—in a corpus of manually annotated German narrative texts. Rule-based as well as machine-learning methods were tested and compared. The results were best for recognizing direct ST&WR (best F1 score: 0.87), followed by indirect (0.71), reported (0.58), and finally free indirect ST&WR (0.40). The rule-based approach worked best for ST&WR types with clear patterns, like indirect and marked direct ST&WR, and often gave the most accurate results. Machine learning was most successful for types without clear indicators, like free indirect ST&WR, and proved more stable. When looking at the percentage of ST&WR in a text, the results of machine-learning methods always correlated best with the results of manual annotation. Creating a union or intersection of the results of the two approaches did not lead to striking improvements. A stricter definition of ST&WR, which excluded borderline cases, made the task harder and led to worse results for both approaches.","2013-12-01","2017-01-03 10:40:19","2017-01-03 10:40:19","2014-08-03 15:20:45","563-575","","4","28","","Lit Linguist Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","llc.oxfordjournals.org","","bibtex: brunner_automatic_2013","","","","style","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows the advantages of using an open and interdisciplinary encoding system that is provided by the XML standard and the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI), but also points out the limits due to the extreme variability of TEI encoding practices and to the difficulty of reconciling a very precise documentary representation of the primary sources encoding practice with identifying the semantic structures relevant for textometric analysis.","2013","2017-01-03 10:41:30","2017-01-03 10:41:30","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Actes du colloque de Lyon, 7-9 mars 2012: « Les dossiers documentaires de Bouvard et Pécuchet » : l’édition numérique du creuset flaubertien.  bibtex: lavrentiev_exploration_2013","","","","","","Dord-Crouslé, Stéphanie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the expected pro t from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected pro t from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected pro t from sales to other customers she may inuence to buy, the customers those may inuence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random eld. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative ltering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers|also known as viral marketing|can be extremely eective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.

TD methods have been used as &quot;adaptive critics&quot; in connectionist learning systems, and have been proposed as models of animal learning in classical conditioning experiments. Here we relate TD methods to decision tasks formulated in terms of a stochastic dynamical system whose behavior unfolds over time under the influence of a decision maker&apos;s actions. Strategies are sought for selecting actions so as to maximize a measure of long-term payoff gain. Mathematically, tasks such as this can be formulated as Markovian decision problems, and numerous methods have been proposed for learning how to solve such problems. We show how a TD method can be understood as a novel synthesis of concepts from the theory of stochastic dynamic programming, which comprises the standard method for solving such tasks when a model of...","1989","2016-08-16 16:43:38","2017-01-02 12:10:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: barto_learning_1989","","","","#pj","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Esta novela se le ha atribuido históricamente, pero existen algunas posiciones encontradas al respecto. Los métodos usados en este artículo contemplan: regresión logística, regresión logística aditiva, análisis discriminante lineal, cuadrático, regularizado, de mezclas y flexible, árboles de clasificación, método de los k-ésimos vecinos más cercanos, método de Bayes ingenuo y máquinas de soporte vectorial. Los métodos fueron calibrados y aplicados utilizando un corpus de autores contemporáneos a Cervantes (Lope de Vega, Jerónimo de Pasamonte, Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, Mateo Alemán y Francisco de Quevedo) junto con más de cuarenta variables, principalmente palabras y signos de puntuación, medidas sobre muestras de los textos escritos por estos autores. Con respecto a estos métodos, la mayoría clasifica la obra como cervantina; sin embargo, es recomendable ampliar el corpus utilizado para el estudio e incluir más autores para la comparación.","2011","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-09 08:41:08","","15-37","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","bibtex: lopez_donde_2011","","","","lang_esp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our paper explores conceptual patterns crisis management behaviour, drawing upon Lalonde's (2004) archetypes of crisis managers as collectivists, integrators, and reactives. We add a paralytics archetype for our analysis. Key findings include an imbalance between counterproductive and constructive archetypes. Reactive and paralytic crisis manager behaviours were over-represented, significantly contributing to conflict, communication failures, and the systemic failure of governments. Collectivist and integrator archetypes were badly under-represented, limiting intergovernmental relations, cooperation, and communication embedded in these behaviour types. Crisis management performance with future crises would benefit from a systematic assessment of crisis management styles and behaviours.

Previous topic model approaches, such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have shown impressive success in discovering low-rank hidden structures for modeling text documents. These approaches, however do not take into account the manifold structure of the data, which is generally informative for nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping. More recent topic model approaches, Laplacian PLSI (LapPLSI) and Locally-consistent Topic Model (LTM), have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown resulting benefits. But they fall short of achieving full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs. In this article, we propose a new approach, Discriminative Topic Model (DTM), which separates non-neighboring pairs from each other in addition to bringing neighboring pairs closer together, thereby preserving the global manifold structure as well as improving local consistency. We also present a novel model-fitting algorithm based on the generalized EM algorithm and the concept of Pareto improvement. We empirically demonstrate the success of DTM in terms of unsupervised clustering and semisupervised classification accuracies on text corpora and robustness to parameters compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","2012-02","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-09 08:41:08","2012-04-19 11:55:58","20:1–20:25","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","bibtex: huh_discriminative_2012","","","","AuthorshipAttribution; TopicModeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B.; Stamatatos, E.","Authorship Attribution for Social Media Forensics","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","","1556-6013","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2603960","","The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time.","2017-01","2017-04-09 10:53:54","2017-04-09 10:53:55","","5-33","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","00003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M. Dominique and Cyril Labbé published a paper entitled “Inter-Textual Distance and Authorship Attribution. Corneille and Molière”. Dominique and Cyril Labbé (hereafter referred to as DCL) propose a new formula for the computation of dissimilarity between texts, as well as a distances scale. They intend to apply it in the field of authorship attribution, and especially in one particular case: a controversy about the authorship of several plays signed by Molière. The object of this paper is to discuss their rationale and conclusions in the light of several simple experiments. Though we will quote DCL's paper throughout, some previous knowledge of its content is recommended. The reader will be also referred to a book written by Dominique Labbé (hereafter DL) in 2003 (Labbé, 2003). In that book, DL recapitulates for a larger audience most of the contents of the paper.

Translated texts, in any language, can be considered a dialect of that language, known as �translationese�. Several characteristics of translationese have been proposed as universal in a series of hypotheses. In this work, we test these hypotheses using a computational methodology that is based on supervised machine learning. We define several classifiers that implement various linguistically informed features, and assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts. We demonstrate that some feature sets are indeed good indicators of translationese, thereby corroborating some hypotheses, whereas others perform much worse (sometimes at chance level), indicating that some �universal� assumptions have to be reconsidered.In memoriam: Miriam Shlesinger, 1947�2012","2015","2016-08-16 16:43:38","2017-01-10 22:26:48","","98-118","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: volansky_features_2013","","","","#pj","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultural and literary aspects of the book are briefly discussed. It is then shown that data on the frequencies and distributions of individual words and recurrent phraseology can not only provide a more detailed descriptive basis for widely accepted literary interpretations of the book, but also identify significant linguistic features which literary critics seem not to have noticed. The argument provides a response to scepticism of quantitative stylistics from both linguists and literary critics.","2005-02-01","2017-01-03 10:29:33","2017-01-03 10:29:33","2014-05-23 10:18:54","5-24","","1","14","","Language and Literature","Conrad in the computer","","","","","","","en","","","","","lal.sagepub.com","","bibtex: stubbs_conrad_2005-1","","","","style","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once trained using works from the core canon of the two dramatists, the network successfully classified works to which it had not been previously exposed. In the light of these favourable results, we used the network to classify a number of anonymous works. Strong support emerged for Tucker Brooke's view that The True Tragedy is the Marlovian original of Henry VI, Part 3, the latter being the product of subsequent revisions by Shakespeare.","1994-01","2017-01-03 10:19:39","2017-01-03 10:19:39","2011-12-14 10:47:21","1 -6","","1","9","","","Neural Computation in Stylometry II","","","","","","","en","","","","","Highwire 2.0","","bibtex: merriam_neural_1994-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A statistic UUU depending on the relative ranks of the xxx's and yyy's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UUU in a sample of nx′snx′sn x's and my′smy′sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nnn and mmm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UUU for samples up to n=m=8n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,nm,nm, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x)>g(x)f(x)>g(x)f(x) > g(x) for every xxx.","1947-03","2017-01-03 10:12:05","2017-01-03 10:12:05","2016-12-11 11:12:26","50-60","","1","18","","Ann.

Cross-validation results are reported for each method, and each method is further employed in classifying the disputed papers and the few papers that are generally understood to be coauthored. These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a “raw” feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second “pre-processed” feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.","2010-06","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-09 08:41:08","2011-12-14 09:35:39","215-223","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Highwire 2.0","","bibtex: jockers_comparative_2010-1","","","","AuthorshipAttribution; MachineLearning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we apply stylometry to a novel dataset of multi-authored documents collected from Wikia using both relaxed classification with a support vector machine (SVM) and multi-label classification techniques. We define five possible scenarios and show that one, the case where labeled and unlabeled collaborative documents by the same authors are available, yields high accuracy on our dataset while the other, more restrictive cases yield lower accuracies. Based on the results of these experiments and knowledge of the multi-label classifiers used, we propose a hypothesis to explain this overall poor performance. Additionally, we perform authorship attribution of pre-segmented text from the Wikia dataset, and show that while this performs better than multi-label learning it requires large amounts of data to be successful.","2017-06-29","2017-06-28 07:02:26","2017-06-28 07:02:27","2017-06-28 07:02:26","115-135","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Cham","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Cyber Security Cryptography and Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The choice of the syllable is very natural: French poetry is known to be mainly syllabic. More specifically, our software performs a complete transcription of the input into the corresponding sequence of phonemes, using a transcribing module consistent with the specific phonology of classical poetry, which allows the marking and counting of metrical syllables. Our system outputs as well with a series of useful markers (syntactic tags, word boundaries, etc. ). This tool has been developed and tested on a corpus containing all P. Corneille‘s and J. Racine’s plays, totaling about 80,000 verses, and has proved to be almost error free on these data. The metrometer shall provide a very effective tool to tackle the study of rhythm in French poetry with quantitative methods.","1996-04-01","2017-01-03 10:19:39","2017-01-03 10:19:39","2012-09-23 10:10:07","23-31","","1","11","","Lit Linguist Computing","The Metrometer","","","","","","","en","","","","","llc.oxfordjournals.org","","bibtex: beaudouin_metrometer:_1996","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.; Ghanem, N.","Author Identification Using Deep Learning","2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0161","","Authorship identification is the task of identifying the author of a given text from a set of suspects. The main concern of this task is to define an appropriate characterization of texts that captures the writing style of authors. Although deep learning was recently used in different natural language processing tasks, it has not been used in author identification (to the best of our knowledge). In this paper, deep learning is used for feature extraction of documents represented using variable size character n-grams. We apply A Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoder (SDAE) for extracting document features with different settings, and then a support vector machine classifier is used for classification. The results show that the proposed system outperforms its counterparts.","2016-12","2017-02-07 14:59:12","2017-02-07 14:59:12","","898-903","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ways people use words in their writing and in everyday life reflect people's social and psychological states. Whereas most text analysis research has focused on the content of people's writings, the current paper demonstrates that almost-invisible function words can be psychologically relevant as well. Through the analysis of pronouns, prepositions, and other function words used in literature, several studies demonstrate how authors' emotional states, aging processes, theories of mind, and the nature of their romantic and collaborative relationships are revealed through their words. The function word approach provides a glimpse of the rapidly expanding methods available to psychologists interested in tracking the social and psychological worlds of authors. With the upcoming release of data sets such as Google Books, the analysis of literature will likely serve as a foundational method used in the fields of psychology, linguistics, history, and other areas of the behavioral and social sciences.","2011-01-01","2017-01-03 10:38:35","2017-01-03 10:38:35","2012-04-25 15:07:21","34-48","","1","1","","","Using literature to understand authors","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","bibtex: pennebaker_using_2011-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hearst has already tackled this problem with good results (Hearst, 1994). One of her main assumptions is that a change in subject is accompanied by a change in vocabulary. Using this assumption, but by introducing a new measure of word significance, we have been able to build a robust and reliable algorithm which exhibits improved accuracy without sacrificing language independency. 1 Introduction Automatic detection of subject divisions within a text is considered to be a very difficult task even for humans, let alone machines. But such subject divisions are used in more complex tasks in text processing such as text summarisation. An automatic method for marking subject boundaries is highly desirable. Hearst (Hearst, 1994) addresses this problem by applying a statistical method for detecting subjects within text. Hearst describes an algorithm for what she calls...","1997","2016-09-26 16:03:19","2017-01-08 13:01:35","2016-09-26 16:03:19","","","","","","","Detecting Subject Boundaries Within Text","","","","","","","","","","","","citeseerx.ist.psu.edu","","bibtex: richmond_detecting_1997","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the desire to establish the parameters of such a model for the interaction between literary studies and humanities computing - for a model of the new computer-assisted literary criticism - that gave rise to the papers in this collection and to the several conference panel-presentations and discussions that, in their print form, these papers represent.","2002","2017-01-03 10:24:52","2017-01-03 10:24:52","2011-10-11 09:12:40","259-267","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","JSTOR","","ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: A New Computer-Assisted Literary Criticism? / Full publication date: Aug., 2002 / Copyright © 2002 Springer  bibtex: siemens_new_2002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results.This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.","1993-03","2017-01-03 10:18:28","2017-01-03 10:18:28","2016-05-23 06:38:34","61–74","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","bibtex: dunning_accurate_1993-1","","","","Distinctiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, those research efforts have been mostly carried out under the umbrella of `corpus stylistics'. Most of these studies focus on the distribution of words (analyzing keywords, extended lexical phrases, or collocations) to identify textual features that are especially characteristic of an author or particular text. Corpus-based grammatical and pragmatic analyses of literary language are also briefly considered. Then, in the concluding part of the paper, I briefly survey earlier computational and statistical research on authorship attribution and literary style. While that research tradition is in some ways the precursor to more recent work in corpus stylistics, it is also complementary to recent research in its application of sophisticated statistical and computational methods.","2011","2017-04-03 16:15:29","2017-04-05 09:22:23","","15-23","","1","1","","","Corpus linguistics and the study of literature","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","00049","","","","act_StylisticAnalysis; AnalyzeStatistically; bigdata; X-CHECK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply the support vector machine (SVM) to this problem, as it is able to cope with half a million of inputs it requires no feature selection and can process the frequency vector of all words of a text. We performed a number of experiments with texts from a German newspaper. With nearly perfect reliability the SVM was able to reject other authors and detected the target author in 60–80% of the cases. In a second experiment, we ignored nouns, verbs and adjectives and replaced them by grammatical tags and bigrams. This resulted in slightly reduced performance. Author detection with SVMs on full word forms was remarkably robust even if the author wrote about different topics.","2003-05","2017-01-03 10:26:05","2017-01-03 10:26:05","2014-08-03 15:06:19","109–123","","1-2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","bibtex: diederich_authorship_2003-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a neighborhood classification method of Authorship Verification analyzing the similarities of a document of unknown authorship between samples documents of one author, without estimating parameters values from a training data, we implemented two strategies of representation of the documents of an author, an instance based and a profile based one. We will evaluate the methods in different data collections according to the number of samples, the textual genres and the topic addressed. We perform an analysis of the contribution of each function of comparison and each feature used to take as final decision a combination by majority of the votes of each function-feature pair used in the similarity between documents. The tests were carried out using the public data sets of the Authorship Verification PAN 2014 and 2015 competitions. The results obtained are promising and allow us to evaluate our proposal and the identification of future work to be developed.","2017","2017-07-06 14:05:22","2017-07-06 14:05:32","2017-07-06 14:05:22","","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","es","Hereby I transfer exclusively to the Journal "" Computación y         Sistemas "", published by the Computing Research Center (CIC-IPN),      t    he Copyright of the aforementioned paper.

Kinney; Cambridge, 2009) beyond problems of authorship attribution to address broader issues of literary history. Using new methods to answer long-standing questions and challenge traditional assumptions about the underlying patterns and contrasts in the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, Style, Computers, and Early Modern Drama sheds light on, for example, different linguistic usages between plays written in verse and prose, company styles and different character types. As a shift from a canonical survey to a corpus-based literary history founded on a statistical analysis of language, this book represents a fundamentally new approach to the study of English Renaissance literature and proposes a new model and rationale for future computational scholarship in early modern literary studies.","2017","2017-07-16 15:03:35","2017-07-16 15:04:11","","","303","","","","","Style, Computers, and Early Modern Drama","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","eng","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.de/books?id=ULYrDwAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bien que les 46 textes sous étude, transcrits avec une orthographe moderne, ne soient pas lemmatisés et que seuls des échantillons de textes de même longueur aient été utilisés, les indices de distance intertextuelle qu’on a pu ainsi établir empiriquement sont du même ordre de grandeur que ceux qu’ont établis C. et D.
